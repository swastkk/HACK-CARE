## Development of a web portal to provide healthcare access to people in remote areas.

# Problem Statement:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nZKzkN2rvr1QQU2FHOnDe3Jn5nTcL408APds47grbho/edit?usp=sharing

## Project Idea:

The website has a number of cutting-edge features, including access to nearby hospitals, doctors, and pharmacies. The hospital guide has a specific feature that helps patients with appointments at hospitals in outlying places. Also, based on the user's input of symptoms, the website utilises a machine learning model to describe the patient's illness.
